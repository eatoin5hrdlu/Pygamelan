Pygamelan
=========

Pygame Wii-mote musical project

Gamelan (Balinese) music is most interesting for it's microtonal aspects, but it is based upon a pentatonic scale which I've developed a midi scale for.  It has the word 'game' in it, so I decided to name this repository after Pygame and Gamelan music.
